Using library - OpenCV (cv2)
				Ultralytics (YOLO)

Install above Library - pip install opencv-python
						pip install ultralytics

Working - This code uses YOLOv8 to detect objects in a video, tracks their movement, and estimates their speed.
 		  It reads a video file, processes each frame, draws speed estimates, and writes the output to a new video file. 
 		  The SpeedEstimator class calculates speed based on object movement between frames.
